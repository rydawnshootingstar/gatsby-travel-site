<h3>Project Description</h3>
This is a project created with Gatsby's Hello World starter. I wanted to familiarize myself with the framework and add the plugins and features as needed rather than jump in with a more complete out of the box starter. Gatsby is a static site generator built with React, Webpack, GraphQL.
